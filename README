Redesign of my old socket server code:

 * fdes_stream to use stream references instead of pointers.
 * signal_handler now in its own project, and no longer a template
   parameter for socket server.
 * socket_server no longer blocks any signals. Programmer must do this
   with signal_handler, and should normally block at least SIGHUP.
 * socket_server no longer installs the signal handler. Programmer must
   handle this outside this code.
 * Moved service_class out of the template parameters. Instantiation is
   now socket_server<server_body<service_class> >
